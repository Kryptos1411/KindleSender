Very simple wrapper around Calibre to deal with sideloading books to kindle and nothing else. No viewing, editing or any other features of calibre. Requires Calibre to work. Deals with cover art bug.

Feel free to fork and edit as required.

Potential Improvements:
Detect if Calibre is already installed before unzipping file
Clean up temp directory created for conversion and transferring
Higher resolution icon
